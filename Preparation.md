First, we need to download and install JDK. Well, we haven't been done this for a long time. The only thing that we might forget is to set up environment variables. 

We need to set the path of JDK as a new environment variable "JAVA_HOME".
```
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91
```

Then we edit the "PATH" variable and add at the end:
```
;%JAVA_HOME%\bin
```
